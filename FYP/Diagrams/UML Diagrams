entity "City Cameras" as Camera
entity "Edge Device (e.g., Jetson or Raspberry Pi)" as EdgeDevice
entity "YOLO v11 Model" as YoloModel
entity "Tracking Algorithm (e.g., Kalman Filter)" as TrackingAlgorithm
entity "Suspicious Activity Detection" as ActivityDetection
entity "Police System" as PoliceSystem

actor Police
actor "System" as SystemActor

' Define interactions between components and users
Camera -> EdgeDevice: "Feed video stream"
EdgeDevice -> YoloModel: "Process video stream for detection"
YoloModel -> TrackingAlgorithm: "Send detected objects for tracking"
TrackingAlgorithm -> ActivityDetection: "Check suspicious behavior"
ActivityDetection -> PoliceSystem: "Send alerts if suspicious activity detected"
PoliceSystem -> AlertSystem: "Generate real-time alerts"

' Define relationship between components
EdgeDevice -[#red]> YoloModel: "Runs AI model"
TrackingAlgorithm -[#blue]> ActivityDetection: "Tracks individuals"
ActivityDetection -[#green]> PoliceSystem: "Notifies of suspicious activity"
PoliceSystem -[#orange]> AlertSystem: "Sends alerts"

' Define data flow and feedback
PoliceSystem -> EdgeDevice: "Upload image for tracking"
EdgeDevice -> YoloModel: "Locate specific person"
YoloModel -> PoliceSystem: "Return identification and location"
